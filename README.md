#Image Colorization Project

Transform grayscale images into vibrant colored versions with our deep learning model. This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a diverse dataset to bring new life to old photos.

Contents

camera.py: Capture a grayscale photo using your webcam and prepare it for colorization.
dataloader.py: Handles loading and preprocessing of the dataset for training and testing.
final_pretrained_model_30.pth: The pretrained model, trained over 30 epochs for optimized performance.
main.py: The primary script for training the model or colorizing images using the pretrained model.
