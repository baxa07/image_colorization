#Image Colorization Project

Description

This project utilizes a deep learning model to colorize grayscale images automatically. It employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to understand the nuances of color and apply this knowledge to transform grayscale images into colored ones. The repository includes a pre-trained model, scripts for capturing grayscale images and colorizing them, and a custom data loader for model training.
